# Theft/Spottings
- [ ] two types: theft, and spotting
- [ ] should thefts be reported based on parking spot, or raw locations?
    - [ ] best of both worlds: you can either do a raw coordinate or a parking spot
    - [ ] if it's a parking spot, 
        - [ ] it will be displayed nicely in the theft report
        - [ ] adds a theft to the parking spot
        - [ ] displayed on map as a circle around the spot
    - [ ] if it's a raw coordinate
        - [ ]  displayed on map as a circle around the spot
- [ ] add photo of the bike (hard)
- [ ] in case of spotting: DON'T show location, show only contact information
